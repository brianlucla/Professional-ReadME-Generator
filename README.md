# Professional ReadMe Generator
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

The motivation for this project was to make the process of writing ReadMe files more accessible and convenient for users who are creating projects. By being able to write a fully formatted ReadMe file in command line by answering a few prompts, users will be able to much more easily create readMe files for their projects. From this project, I have learned how to user Node.js as well as the inquirer package to take in user input and manipulate that input with JavaScript.
